# Publishing Flow Logs to CloudWatch Logs<a name="flow-logs-cwl"></a>

Flow logs can publish flow log data directly to Amazon CloudWatch\.

When publishing to CloudWatch Logs, flow log data is published to a log group, and each network interface has a unique log stream in the log group\. Log streams contain flow log records\. You can create multiple flow logs that publish data to the same log group\. If the same network interface is present in one or more flow logs in the same log group, it has one combined log stream\. If you've specified that one flow log should capture rejected traffic, and the other flow log should capture accepted traffic, then the combined log stream captures all traffic\. For more information, see [Flow Log Records](flow-logs.md#flow-log-records)\.

## IAM Roles for Publishing Flow Logs to CloudWatch Logs<a name="flow-logs-iam"></a>

The IAM role that's associated with your flow log must have sufficient permissions to publish flow logs to the specified log group in CloudWatch Logs\. The IAM policy that's attached to your IAM role must include at least the following permissions:

```
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Action": [
        "logs:CreateLogGroup",
        "logs:CreateLogStream",
        "logs:PutLogEvents",
        "logs:DescribeLogGroups",
        "logs:DescribeLogStreams"
      ],
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Resource": "*"
    }
  ]
}
```

Also ensure that your role has a trust relationship that allows the flow logs service to assume the role:

```
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Sid": "",
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Principal": {
        "Service": "vpc-flow-logs.amazonaws.com"
      },
      "Action": "sts:AssumeRole"
    }
  ]
}
```

Users must also have permissions to use the iam:PassRole action for the IAM role that's associated with the flow log:

```
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": ["iam:PassRole"],
      "Resource": "arn:aws:iam::account-id:role/flow-log-role-name"
    }
  ]
}
```

You can update an existing role or use the following procedure to create a new role for use with flow logs\.

### Creating a Flow Logs Role<a name="create-flow-logs-role"></a>

**To create an IAM role for flow logs**

1. Open the IAM console at [https://console\.aws\.amazon\.com/iam/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/)\.

1. In the navigation pane, choose **Roles**, **Create role**\.

1. Choose **EC2** as the service to use this role\. For **Use case**, choose **EC2**\. Choose **Next: Permissions**\.

1. On the **Attach permissions policies** page, choose **Next: Tags** and optionally add tags\. Choose **Next: Review**\.

1. Enter a name for your role \(for example, `Flow-Logs-Role`\) and optionally provide a description\. Choose **Create role**\.

1. Select the name of your role\. For **Permissions**, choose **Add inline policy**, **JSON**\.

1. Copy the first policy from [IAM Roles for Publishing Flow Logs to CloudWatch Logs](#flow-logs-iam) and paste it in the window\. Choose **Review policy**\.

1. Enter a name for your policy, and choose **Create policy**\.

1. Select the name of your role\. For **Trust relationships**, choose **Edit trust relationship**\. In the existing policy document, change the service from `ec2.amazonaws.com` to `vpc-flow-logs.amazonaws.com`\. Choose **Update Trust Policy**\.

1. On the **Summary** page, note the ARN for your role\. You need this ARN when you create your flow log\.

## Creating a Flow Log that Publishes to CloudWatch Logs<a name="flow-logs-cwl-create-flow-log"></a>

You can create flow logs for your VPCs, subnets, or network interfaces\.

**To create a flow log for a network interface**

1. Open the Amazon EC2 console at [https://console\.aws\.amazon\.com/ec2/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/)\.

1. In the navigation pane, choose **Network Interfaces**\.

1. Select one or more network interfaces and choose **Actions**, **Create flow log**\.

1. For **Filter**, specify the type of IP traffic data to log\. Choose **All** to log accepted and rejected traffic, **Rejected** to record only rejected traffic, or **Accepted** to record only accepted traffic\.

1. For **Destination**, choose **Send to CloudWatch Logs**\.

1. For **Destination log group**, type the name of a log group in CloudWatch Logs to which the flow logs are to be published\. If you specify the name of a log group that does not exist, we attempt to create the log group for you\.

1. For **IAM role**, specify the name of the role that has permissions to publish logs to CloudWatch Logs\.

1. Choose **Create**\.

**To create a flow log for a VPC or a subnet**

1. Open the Amazon VPC console at [https://console\.aws\.amazon\.com/vpc/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/vpc/)\.

1. In the navigation pane, choose **Your VPCs** or **Subnets**\.

1. Select one or more VPCs or subnets and then choose **Actions**, **Create flow log**\.

1. For **Filter**, specify the type of IP traffic data to log\. Choose **All** to log accepted and rejected traffic, **Rejected** to record only rejected traffic, or **Accepted** to record only accepted traffic\.

1. For **Destination**, choose **Send to CloudWatch Logs**\.

1. For **Destination log group**, type the name of a log group in CloudWatch Logs to which the flow logs are to be published\. If you specify the name of a log group that does not exist, we attempt to create the log group for you\.

1. For **IAM role**, specify the name of the IAM role that has permissions to publish logs to CloudWatch Logs\.

1. Choose **Create**\.

## Processing Flow Log Records in CloudWatch Logs<a name="process-records-cwl"></a>

You can work with flow log records as you would with any other log events collected by CloudWatch Logs\. For more information about monitoring log data and metric filters, see [Searching and Filtering Log Data](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/DeveloperGuide/MonitoringLogData.html) in the *Amazon CloudWatch User Guide*\.

### Example: Creating a CloudWatch Metric Filter and Alarm for a Flow Log<a name="flow-logs-cw-alarm-example"></a>

In this example, you have a flow log for `eni-1a2b3c4d`\. You want to create an alarm that alerts you if there have been 10 or more rejected attempts to connect to your instance over TCP port 22 \(SSH\) within a 1\-hour time period\. First, you must create a metric filter that matches the pattern of the traffic for which to create the alarm\. Then, you can create an alarm for the metric filter\.

**To create a metric filter for rejected SSH traffic and create an alarm for the filter**

1. Open the CloudWatch console at [https://console\.aws\.amazon\.com/cloudwatch/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/)\.

1. In the navigation pane, choose **Logs**.

1. Select the associated **Metric Filters** value for the your Flow Log log group\.

1. Select **Add Metric Filter**\.

1. For **Filter Pattern**, enter the following:

   ```
   [version, account, eni, source, destination, srcport, destport="22", protocol="6", packets, bytes, windowstart, windowend, action="REJECT", flowlogstatus]
   ```

1. For **Select Log Data to Test**, select the log stream for your network interface\. \(Optional\) To view the lines of log data that match the filter pattern, choose **Test Pattern**\. When you're ready, choose **Assign Metric**\.

1. Provide a metric namespace and name, and ensure that the metric value is set to **1**\. When you're done, choose **Create Filter**\.

1. In the navigation pane, choose **Alarms**, **Create Alarm**\.

1. In the **Custom Metrics** section, choose the namespace for the metric filter that you created\.
**Note**  
It can take a few minutes for a new metric to display in the console\.

1. Select the metric name that you created, and choose **Next**\.

1. Enter a name and description for the alarm\. For the **is** fields, choose **>=** and enter **10**\. For the **for** field, leave the default **1** for the consecutive periods\.

1. For **Period**, choose **1 Hour**\. For **Statistic**, choose **Sum**\. The `Sum` statistic ensures that you are capturing the total number of data points for the specified time period\. 

1. In the **Actions** section, you can choose to send a notification to an existing list\. Or, you can create a new list and enter the email addresses that should receive a notification when the alarm is triggered\. When you are done, choose **Create Alarm**\.
